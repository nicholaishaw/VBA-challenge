# VBA-challenge

The idea of the formula "Cells(i, 1).Value <> Cells(i + 1, 1).Value" in line of the first IF statement in the first FOR loop statement in all three VB files came from a discussion from classmate Julia Khron on Slack.

In addition, the teaching assistant Andy Vicario assisted with the development of the "Cells(TickerVariable, 10).Value = open_value - close_value" line in the first if statement to calculate the yearly change.
